# Quiz Password Change
Moodle Admin Tool
  
Allows admins to change quiz passwords by course.  
There is an option to leave blank passwords blank (but update all others). This is useful in case one desires to have quizzes without passwords, and quizzes with passwords in one course.  
  
Installs to Site administration->Plugins->Admin Tools.
